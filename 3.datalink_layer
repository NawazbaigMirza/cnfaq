7.1.What is data link layer?
Data Link Layer is second layer of OSI Layered Model. Data link layer is responsible for converting data stream to signals bit by bit and to send that over the underlying hardware.

2.Functions of data link layer
1.framing
2.addressing
3.synchronization
4.error control
5.flow control 
6.multi-access

2.Tyes of errors
single bit error:In a frame, there is only one bit, anywhere though, which is corrupt.
Multiple bits error:Frame is received with more than one bits in corrupted state.
Burst error:Frame contains more than1 consecutive bits corrupted.

3.What are the error control mechanism?
1.error detection
2.error correction

4.The data link layer takes the packets from _____ and encapsulates them into frames for transmission.
  network layer
 
5. When 2 or more bits in a data unit has been changed during the transmission, the error is called
    burst error
    
6.Which one of the following is the multiple access protocol for channel access control?
  a) CSMA/CD
  b) CSMA/CA
7.Automatic repeat request error management mechanism is provided by: 
  logical link control sublayer 
8.Header of a frame generally contains: 
frame identifier
