1. What is Computer Network ? 
Computer Network is collection of computers connected together for exchanging information. 

2. Why we need computer network?
Computer network help the user to share the resources and in communication. It useful for file sharing , communication ,
application sharing , lan gaming and many more.

3. What are types of the computer network ?
    Hint LAN, MAN, WAN
    
4. What are the types of data flows in computer ?
     Simplex :- Communication is unidirectional
     Half Duplex :- Each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time
     Full Duplex :- Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously

5. What are the various network topologies ? 
    a)Bus topology consists of one main cable to which all nodes are connected.
    b)Star topology is where all nodes are connected to a central hub using point-to-point connection.
    c)In Ring topology, the computers in the network are connected in a circular fashion, and the data travels in one direction.
    d)Mesh topology is where every node has a direct point-to-point connection to every other node.

6. Compare network topologies 


7. What is internet ?
    A collection of interconnected networks is internet. Also known as a network of networks.
    
8. Two devices are in network if
    a) a process in one device is able to exchange information with a process in another device
    b) a process is running on both devices
    c) PIDs of the processes running of different devices are same
    d) none of the mentioned
Ans. a)

9. In computer network nodes are
    a) the computer that originates the data
    b) the computer that routes the data
    c) the computer that terminates the data
    d) all of the mentioned
Ans. d)

10. A _____ is a device that forwards packets between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet.
    a) bridge
    b) firewall
    c) router
    d) all of the mentioned
Ans. c)

11. What is a node?
Ans.    A node refers to a point or joint where a connection takes place. 
        It can be computer or device that is part of a network. 
        Two or more nodes are needed in order to form a network connection.
        
12.  What are routers?
Ans.    Routers can connect two or more network segments. These are intelligent network devices that store information 
        in its routing table such as paths, hops and bottlenecks. 
        With this info, they are able to determine the best path for data transfer. Routers operate at the OSI Network Layer.
        
13. Name the types of reference models.
    a)OSI Reference model (Open Systems interconnection).
    b)TCP/IP Reference model.
    
14. What are protocols?
    Protocol is a standard used to define a method of exchanging data over a computer network.
    For example : TCP, IP, UDP, POP, SMTP, HTTP, and FTP 


15. Function of OSI Model?

    Layer 7: The application layer. This is the layer at which communication partners are identified (Is there someone 
        to talk to?), network capacity is assessed (Will the network let me talk to them right now?), and that creates a 
        thing to send or opens the thing received.  (This layer is not the application itself, it is the set of services 
        an application should be able to make use of directly, although some applications may perform application layer 
        functions.)
    
    Layer 6: The presentation layer. This layer is usually part of an operating system (OS) and converts incoming and 
        outgoing data from one presentation format to another (for example, from clear text to encrypted text at one 
        end and back to clear text at the other).

    Layer 5: The session layer. This layer sets up, coordinates and terminates conversations. Services include 
        authentication and reconnection after an interruption. On the Internet, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and 
        User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provide these services for most applications.

    Layer 4: The transport layer. This layer manages packetization of data, then the delivery of the packets, including 
        checking for errors in the data once it arrives. On the Internet, TCP and UDP provide these services for most 
        applications as well.

    Layer 3: The network layer. This layer handles the addressing and routing of the data (sending it in the right direction 
        to the right destination on outgoing transmissions and receiving incoming transmissions at the packet level). IP is the 
        network layer for the Internet.

    Layer 2: The data-link layer. This layer sets up links across the physical network, putting packets into network frames. 
        This layer has two sub-layers, the Logical Link Control Layer and the Media Access Control Layer. Ethernet is the main 
        data link layer in use.

    Layer 1: The physical layer. This layer conveys the bit stream through the network at the electrical, optical or 
        radio level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier networ

19.How many digits of the DNIC (Data Network Identification Code) identify the country?
ans.first three

20.The probability that a single bit will be in error on a typical public telephone line using 4800 bps modem is 10 to the power -3.
If no error detection mechanism is used, the residual error rate for a communication line using 9-bit
frames is approximately equal to
ANS:0.009
